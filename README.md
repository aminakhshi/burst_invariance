Metzen MG, Akhshi A, et al. (2025) Burst firing optimizes invariant coding of natural communication signals by electrosensory neural populations. iScience [doi:10.1016/j.isci.2025.112399](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2025.112399)

## Description
This repository provides code for analyzing how burst firing in neural populations can give rise to an invariant representation of highly heterogeneous natural communication stimuli. The code supports multi-unit recordings from central sensory neural populations and computational modeling to demonstrate that optimal invariance is achieved for levels of burst firing seen experimentally.
